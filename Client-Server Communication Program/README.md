## Java Client-Server Communication

### Description:

A simple console-based client-server application in Java demonstrating basic network communication using sockets. The client connects to the server, sends a message, and the server responds accordingly. This is a beginner-friendly project to learn Java I/O, networking, and multithreading fundamentals.

### Key Features:

    1. Java socket programming (TCP-based)

    2. Message exchange between client and server

    3. Demonstrates client-server architecture

    4. Console-based interaction

    5. Easy to modify and expand

### How to Run:
      
      Compile Programs: javac Server.java, javac Client.java

      Execute Programs: java Server, java Client

### Requirements:

    1. Java 8 or higher

    2. Two terminal windows (or tabs) to run server and client separately

    3. Basic understanding of sockets and I/O streams

### Networking Tip:

Always start the server first so it's ready to accept connections when the client tries to connect. You can customize the port or response logic for more advanced features!
